Manipulating the flow of cold atoms promises practical devices for quantum technologies. Here, we study a three-terminal atomic ring circuit pierced by a synthetic magnetic flux as a powerful multi-functional device. The flux controls the transport through the ring via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The device can measure the flux in-situ via a flux-induced transition of the reflections from negative Andreev-like to positive. By exciting the system we break an emergent symmetry of the flux. This allows us to direct the atomic current into specific output ports via the flux, realizing a flexible non-reciprocal switch to connect multiple atomic systems together. Our system allows us to study the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect in a controllable manner. While the Aharonov-Bohm effect for time-dependent magnetic fields and electrons is an open problem, for cold atoms we observe a clear periodic modulation of the current with a time-dependent synthetic flux. This allows us to realize an atomic frequency generator as well as a converter between direct and alternating current. Our results can be directly implemented in experiments to create novel quantum technological devices.
