Quantum computers are expected to help us to achieve accurate simulation of the dynamics of many-body quantum systems. However, the limitations of current NISQ devices prevents us from realising this goal today. Recently an algorithm for performing quantum simulations called quantum assisted simulator has been proposed that promises realization on current experimental devices. In this work, we extend the quantum assisted simulator to simulate the dynamics of a class of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the quantum assisted simulator is easier to implement as well as can realize multi-qubit interactions and challenging driving protocols that are difficult with other existing methods. We demonstrate this for a time-dependent Hamiltonian on the IBM Quantum Experience cloud quantum computer by showing superior performance of the quantum assisted simulator compared to Trotterization and variational quantum simulation. Our results indicate that quantum assisted simulator is a promising algorithm for current term quantum hardware.
