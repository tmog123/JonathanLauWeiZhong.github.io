In this short review article, we aim to provide physicists not working within the quantum computing community a hopefully easy-to-read introduction to the state of the art in the field, with minimal mathematics involved. In particular, we focus on what is termed the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era of quantum computing. We describe how this is increasingly seen to be a distinct phase in the development of quantum computers, heralding an era where we have quantum computers that are capable of doing certain quantum computations in a limited fashion, and subject to certain constraints and noise. We further discuss the prominent algorithms that are believed to hold the most potential for this era, and also describe the competing physical platforms on which to build a quantum computer that have seen the most success so far. We then talk about the applications that are most feasible in the near-term, and finish off with a short discussion on the state of the field. We hope that as non-experts read this article, it will give context to the recent developments in quantum computers that have garnered much popular press, and help the community understand how to place such developments in the timeline of quantum computing.
