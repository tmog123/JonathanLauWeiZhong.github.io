## Research Interests

* Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) Simulation Algorithms: With the development of near term quantum computers, we are entering the NISQ era of quantum computing, which is characterized by us having access to quantum computers with a hundred to a few thousand qubits. The number of qubits of such computers is large enough such that classical computers should not be able to accurately simulate the results of calculations run by such quantum computers, however not large enough to implement error-correcting codes, implying that he calculations of such computers are subject to high levels of noise. Such computers also commonly face architectural constraints, with limited connectivity between qubits. While we should continue to strive to develop larger and less noisy quantum computers, we foresee that we will be in this era for a long period of time. As such, we should aim to develop and characterize algorithms that are able to deal with the limitations posed by such computers. One of the biggest hoped-for advantages of having a useful quantum computer is its theoretical capability to perform simulations of quantum many-body dynamics problems. However, the algorithms so far developed for NISQ computers are in their infacy and we do not fully understand how much the effect of noise will affect their calculations, nor do we know if it is even possible to achieve quantum advantage over classical computers in the NISQ era. 


* Atomtronics: Recent developments in cold atom systems has allowed us the ability to control atomic matter-waves of ultra-cold atoms. This allows us to realize circuits of atoms, which are analogs of electrical circuits, but with the current carriers being bosons or generic fermions as opposed to electrons. Furthermore, we have the ability to manipulate such atoms coherently in a large variety of trap potentials, giving us the tools to study physics in many different geometries. Such systems allow us a method to perform analog simulations of quantum many-body problems, and allow us a tool to develop new technologies.


* Integrated Photonic Chips: Such platforms have many potential applications, such as in quantum computing. We are exploring alternative uses, like speeding up and efficiently implementing classical machine learning models on such devices.

* The application of Density Functional Theory to cold atom systems.
