Welcome! I am Jonathan Lau, a PhD student at the [Center for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org), located in the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg), which is also where I obtained my BSc (Hons) in physics from. I am under the supervision of Professor [Kwek Leong Chuan](https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/kwek). My research interests are somewhat broad, but the common theme is investigating how we might use the energing platforms that the field of quantum technologies is providing us (in particular quantum simulators and near term quantum computers) for practical purposes. In particular, we have an interest in utilizing such platforms to study dynamics in many-body physics.
