Welcome! I am Jonathan Lau Wei Zhong, a PhD student at the [Center for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org), located in the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg). I am under the supervision of Professor [Kwek Leong Chuan](https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/kwek). 

I have strong interest in modelling systems and phenomena in the real world with mathematical tools. 3 years of experience in the quantum computing field, analyzing near-term quantum algorithms, and working with experimentalists to realize quantum devices for machine learning and sensing. Strengths in research, mathematical modelling, data analysis. Highly accountable and patient, and naturally inquisitive.

In my spare time I like to read history books, play video games, and pursue my hobby of wine tasting. I also blog about random topics from time to time.
