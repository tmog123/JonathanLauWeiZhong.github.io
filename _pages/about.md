Welcome! I am Jonathan Lau, a PhD student at the [Center for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org), located in the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg), which is also where I obtained my BSc (Hons) in physics from. I am under the supervision of Professor [Kwek Leong Chuan](https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/kwek). My research interests are somewhat broad, but the common theme is investigating how we might use the energing platforms that the field of quantum technologies is providing us (in particular quantum simulators and near term quantum computers) for practical purposes. In particular, we have an interest in utilizing such platforms to study dynamics in many-body physics.

## Research Interests

* Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) Simulation Algorithms: With the development of near term quantum computers, we are entering the NISQ era of quantum computing, which is characterized by us having access to quantum computers with a hundred to a few thousand qubits. The number of qubits of such computers is large enough such that classical computers should not be able to accurately simulate the results of calculations run by such quantum computers, however not large enough to implement error-correcting codes, implying that he calculations of such computers are subject to high levels of noise. Such computers also commonly face architectural constraints, with limited connectivity between qubits. While we should continue to strive to develop larger and less noisy quantum computers, we foresee that we will be in this era for a long period of time.


* Atomtronics, using cold boson gases to study many-body physics models:


* Using photonic chips for machine learning in quantum chemistry:
