Welcome! I am Jonathan Lau Wei Zhong, a PhD student at the [Center for Quantum Technologies](https://www.quantumlah.org), located in the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg). I am under the supervision of Professor [Kwek Leong Chuan](https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/kwek). 

My research interests are somewhat broad, but the common theme is investigating how we might use the energing platforms that the field of quantum technologies is providing us (in particular quantum simulators and near term quantum computers) for practical purposes. In particular, we have an interest in utilizing such platforms to study dynamics in many-body physics. 

My current research projects can be found under the Research tab.

I actively work with experimentalists, and have ongoing collaborations with the experimental photonics group at the Quantum Science and Engineering Centre in NTU, and the experimental atomtronics group under [Rainer Dumke](https://www.quantumlah.org/research/group/rdumke).

In my spare time I like to read history books, play video games, and pursue my hobby of wine tasting.
